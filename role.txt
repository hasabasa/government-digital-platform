You are integrating role-based access control into an existing frontend without altering UI or component structure.

Roles to implement:
1. Minister:
   - Can send messages to all department heads in their ministry.
   - Can message any employee in the system.
   - Can issue orders (visible to department heads and below).
   - Can create tasks for any employee.
   - Has a general chat with ministry colleagues.

2. Department Head:
   - Can message all employees in their department.
   - Can issue orders for the department.
   - Can create tasks for section heads and employees.
   - Has chats with section heads and ministry leadership.

3. Section Head:
   - Can message employees in their section.
   - Can create tasks for the section or specific employees.
   - Has chats with section employees and department leadership.

4. Employee:
   - Sees news feed.
   - Can message colleagues in their section.
   - Can create personal tasks and (with permission) tasks for section colleagues.
   - Cannot see orders above their level.

Requirements:
- Fetch role info from backend endpoint: GET /api/v1/users/profile
- Store role in frontend state (e.g., Zustand store).
- Conditionally render available actions (create task, issue order, send message) based on role.
- Hide or disable UI actions that user role is not permitted to perform.
- When creating tasks or sending messages, dynamically filter recipient list based on role hierarchy.
- When viewing orders, only display those allowed for current role.
- All role checks must be done both in frontend (for UX) and backend (for security).

Ensure:
- No changes to existing UI design.
- Role logic should be integrated with existing task creation, chat, and orders modules.
- Role restrictions must be enforced for API calls (block unauthorized actions).
